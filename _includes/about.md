Today, algorithms, data, and recently AI, are indispensable to how we work. And how we work is critical to our health and consequently how we experience life. Workers increasingly report work-related challenges as drivers of stress, anxiety, and depression; while receiving inadequate support.  Meanwhile, digital technology continues to redefine workâ€”especially post-COVID-19 remote work and large foundation models. How do ensure these technological advancements do not trap workers into more work and instead unlock new paradigms of wellbeing? 

**Our lab's mission is to reimagine technology to ensure healthier & happier forms of work.** We study a variety of working populations (knowledge workers, emotion workers, neurodiverse workers) and settings (remote, gig, shift, creative). Together, we take an end-to-end perspective to improve wellbeing through intelligent, pragmatic, and scalable socio-technical solutions.

**Human-Centered ML:**
Existing approaches to understand workers with data, rarely consider worker perspectives. We engage with data-subjects, like workers, to derive new designs for estimating behavioral health and guide these models to align ethically and practically with their social context.

**Social-Ecological Informatics:**
Traditional ways of describing workers does not reflect how social relationships affect their behaviors. We contextualize situations with multimodal data and demonstrate computational models that highlight overlooked factors associated with healthier organizational practices.

**Digital Wellbeing Interventions:**
Performance and wellness are often viewed as mutually exclusive, but we show that we can augment work routines to ensure sustainable effectiveness. We develop AI and computational applications for task-level and day-level activities to mitigate negative challenges to mental health.
