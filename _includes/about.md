Algorithms, data, and AI are indispensable to how we work. And how we work is critical to our health and consequently how we experience life. Workers increasingly report work-related challenges as drivers of stress, anxiety, and depression while receiving inadequate support. Meanwhile, digital technology continues to redefine workâ€”especially with hybrid work trends and the emergence of large foundation models. How do we ensure these technological advancements do not trap workers into more work and instead unlock new paradigms of holistic wellbeing?

**Our lab's mission is to reimagine technology to ensure healthier & happier forms of work.** We study a variety of working populations (knowledge workers, emotion workers, neurodivergent workers) and settings (remote, gig, shift, creative). Together, we take an end-to-end perspective to improve wellbeing through intelligent, pragmatic, and scalable socio-technical solutions.
