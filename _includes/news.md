**Prospective Students:** Please read my advising statement before contacting. I’m looking for 1–2 PhD students this cycle. If you’re interested, please apply to the PhD program in [Human-Centered Technology, Innovation & Design](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/human-centered-technology-innovation-design-phd) and mention my name in your application. If you are interested in a post-doc position, please email me directly. Unfortunately I no longer have time to supervise undergraduates or MS students. If you think you have a compelling story though, feel free to reach out.
